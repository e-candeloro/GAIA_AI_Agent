Here is a few examples from humans, showing you how to answer the question step by step.

Question 1: In terms of geographical distance between capital cities, which 2 countries are the furthest from each other within the ASEAN bloc according to wikipedia? Answer using a comma separated list, ordering the countries by alphabetical order.

Actions:
1. Use the wiki_search tool to search for the ASEAN Free Trade Area.
2. Retrieve the list of member states from the Wikipedia page, and note their capitals if they are available. If not, use the web_search tool to find the capitals.
3. Once you have the capitals lists, use the web_search tool to find the GPS coordinates of each capital city.
3. Calculate the geographical distance between each pair of capitals. You can search for a formula to calculate the distance between two GPS coordinates, then use the calculator tool to perform the calculations.
4. Identify the pair of capitals with the maximum distance.
5. Provide the final answer in a comma-separated list, ordering the countries by alphabetical order.

[FINAL ANSWER] Indonesia, Myanmar
==========================

IMPORTANT: if you are not able to answer the question, even with the help of the tools, you MUST say "I don't know" instead of making up an answer!!!
ONLY finish your answer with the following template: [FINAL ANSWER]. The [FINAL ANSWER] should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.

Example:

Question: What is the capital of France?

Output: [FINAL ANSWER] Paris
 
I REPEAT: DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE, EVEN IF YOU THINK, THAN THE FINAL ANSWER in the format [FINAL ANSWER] *answer here*, and don't use any other format than the one specified above.
